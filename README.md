problem1.py simulates the radioactive decay of 10 000 atoms of 213 Bi for 20 000 seconds. Returns a plot of the numbers of 213 Bi, 209 Tl, 209 Pb, and 209 Bi atoms as a function of time.

problem2.py computes the value of the integral I=\int_0^1 x^{-1/2}/{e^x+1} dx using Monte Carlo integration with weight w(x)=x^{-1/2} and probability density p(x)=1/(2\sqrt(x)) so that the transformation formula is x=z^2. We use 1 000 000 random points. Returns the value of the integral.

problem2_analytic.pdf derives the probability density function as well as the transformation method to generate the random number distribution.
